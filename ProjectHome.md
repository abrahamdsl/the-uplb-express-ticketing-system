The UPLB Express Ticketing System is a Transaction Processing System (TPS) designed to automate the processes related in gaining entry to certain events in the campus such as plays and lectures, via the use of the Internet and a service it provides, the World Wide Web. Booking or reservation; selection, changing or cancellation of seats  and/or slots  can be done from the convenience of the clientele's supported electronic devices that have an up-to-date, standards-conforming web browser. The administrators of the event can perform necessary tasks too, like postponing an event and transferring customers to other showings. In addition to that, there will be also corresponding `check-in' and `check-out' applications for use during the event, for checking the attendance of the attendees and determining if there are some booked clients who did not appear on or before the required time, so their slots can be given and/or sold to customers who are on a waitlist. Those who need the attendance information like teachers who require their students to attend an event will be given access to the appropriate section of the application with regard to attendance records. This will result in lesser, if not elimination of, chaos seen during the said events before the realization of this proposal.
