	<h2>The UPLB Express Ticketing System</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>
		Welcome! The UPLB Express Ticketing System is a transaction
processing system (TPS) designed to automate the processes
related in gaining entry to certain events in the University of the Philippines Los Banos  such as
plays and lectures, via the use of the World Wide Web. Currently,
all processes are done manually and the author is not aware of
any researches that tried to answer the problems arising from
such. With this TPS, reservation, changing or cancellation of slots
and seats can be done conveniently using the clientele's computer,
among other features.
